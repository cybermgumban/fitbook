# fitbook

This is my pet project Fitbook.

It is currently in MVP stage, and focused on front-end development with basic back-end stuffs.

You may view the web app at cybermgumban.github.io, sign-up for an account and post chat, add friend.

I need to run the node backend every time you need to test my application, so feel free to message me, you may find me at www.cybermgumban.com
